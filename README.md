## Project Description

The objective of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of combinations of **Weight Initializers (WIs)** and **Activation Functions (AFs)** for CNN models to explore the impact of AFs and WIs, and whether there exists an optimal pairing that consistently works well across various CNN architectures. This material can be served as a reference for selecting suitable configurations in future deep learning projects and research.

### Key Components:
- Conducting an in-depth literature review on the topic (e.g., activation functions, weight initializers)
- Highlighting and analyzing related work
- Citing and referencing credible academic sources
- Structuring, drafting, and revising a technical paper
- Presenting findings in a clear and concise manner
- Performing experiments using the chosen architecture (VGG19)

## Results
Our findings are:
- The interactions between AFs and WIs can vary across different model architectures. In particular, models incorporating batch normalization layers exhibit behaviors that differ from those reported in earlier studies.
- More recent combinations can improve the performance compared to traditional pairings (e.g., ELU and LSUV)
