# WR227_Group6

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository hosts all materials related to the **WR227 - Technical Writing** course project. It serves as a centralized workspace for research artifacts, drafts, notes, and final deliverables developed by **Group 6**.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

The objective of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of combinations of **Weight Initializers (WIs)** and **Activation Functions (AFs)** for CNN models (e.g., VGG19). Additionally, we aim to explore whether there exists an optimal pairing that consistently works well across various CNN architectures. This material is intended to serve as a reference for selecting suitable configurations in future deep learning projects.

### Key Components:
- Conducting an in-depth literature review on the topic (e.g., activation functions, weight initializers)
- Highlighting and analyzing related work
- Citing and referencing credible academic sources
- Structuring, drafting, and revising a technical paper
- Presenting findings in a clear and concise manner
- Performing experiments using the chosen architecture (VGG19)

**Final topic:**  
> *Activation Functions and Weight Initializers for CNNs: A Comparative Study*  
> [ðŸ“„ View Paper (PDF)](Final_paper.pdf)
